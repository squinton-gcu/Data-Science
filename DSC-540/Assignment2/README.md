Here are the results for assignment 2
The goal of this assignment was to create a k-nearest neighbor algorithm for the mnist dataset

Assignment2_DSC540_QuintonNotebook.ipynb = The Jupyter Notebook of the algorithm
Assignment2_DSC540_QuintonNotebook.pdf = the notebook in pdf version
Assignment2_pycode.py = the raw python code of the algorithm
Assignment2_QuintonReport.pdf = the written report of this assignment

Instructions:
Import the package kNeighborsClassifier.
Be mindful of the train-test split and set the parameters accordingly (justify your choice).
Identify the variables in the dataset and define the Euclidean distance between an element in the test set and the training set.
Calculate the distance between the test element and each of if its k nearest neighbors.
Count the occurrence of each digit within the k nearest neighbors and identify the most popular digit.
Identify the test element as the digit voted as most popular in the set of the k nearest neighbors.
Classify the test element accordingly (i.e. based on the popular vote).
Calculate the error.
